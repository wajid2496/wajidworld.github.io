For full installation instructions please read the manual.

A summary to install and run the program follows:-

A:
INSTALL C:\ALADDIN\
C:
CD \ALADDIN
SETSND
ALADDIN



N.B.

For slow machines, selecting NO SOUND within the SETSND program
will show a marked improvement in speed.

For machines with less than the required 570K of base memory free
similarly selecting NO SOUND within the SETSND program will
enable the program to run with less memory.

The program makes use of 1Mb of XMS and 1Mb of EMS and therefore
both of these must be present in your machine.
This is usually accomplished by having the EMM386 driver in your
CONFIG.SYS file.

The basic version of Aladdin requires 570K of base memory.  However,
selecting enhanced music mode during the SETSND program will require
more base memory in order to play music.  Similarly, the more
sophisticated your sound card (Stereo or 16-Bit) the more memory
the program will require.  If you do not get music playing within
the game, try freeing up more base memory or selecting NO to 
enhanced music or selecting a simpler version of your sound card.

During the game, the volume of the music may be adjusted by pressing
the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN.  This controls the volume with respect to
the sound effects.
